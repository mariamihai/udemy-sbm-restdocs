# SBM Spring REST Docs Example
Using REST Docs for documenting a Spring Boot project.

## Description
The current project is based on the ["Spring Boot Microservices with Spring Cloud"](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-microservices-with-spring-cloud-beginner-to-guru/) course and follows Section 8 - "Spring MVC REST Docs project".

The issues available on this repo document the process of creating the documentation with Spring MVC REST Docs and Asciidoctor.

## Status
**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the section of the course and the associated project, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.
